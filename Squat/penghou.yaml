# Read leg length from atlas.urdf file:
#	upper_leg = 0.374
#	lower_leg = 0.422
# 	Limit radians value for
#	    knee: 		kny = {0, 2.45}
#	    ankle:  	uay = {-0.698, 0.698}	    
#		lower hip:  lhy = {-1.745, 0.524}
# Calculation:
#	Assume the back and ankle align. so we get the relationship
#		cos(uay)*lower_leg = cos(lhy)*upper_leg
#		kny = uay + lhy
#	choose a random value for any joint, we can calculate other values.
